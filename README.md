# POC of Firebase Remote Config

This project is a proof of concept that intends to validate the Firebase Remote Config tool implementation and serve as a base to compare with other tools for future implementation at Loggi.

## Technology

Stuff we use:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/).
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)** a comprehensive app development platform.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
